## Introduction

This project allows you to, instead of clicking or using hotkeys, to voice your commands to world of warcraft! Just lay down put your character on auto run and start screaming out abilitis to kill things. Works especially well on ranged characters with instant casts!

## Usage

The first thing you have to do is assign all hotkeys for abilities your going to use. To do this you first have to assign generic hotkeys like, auto-run, eat, mount, and tab-targeting. Then go into your specific class and spec and assign abillities there. Click on the buttons and then assign whatever button from your keyboard you want to use. Keep in mind that the hotkeys need to correspond with the abilities on your hotbars in game!

## Voice commands

The actual commands are just your ability names exactly. Say "Arcane blast" to cast arcane blast or "flame strike" to cast flame strike! 

However there are some special commands specifically

"Eat": Eat food on your hotbar

"Mount": Mount up with the mount you have on your hotbar!

"auto run": Turn on auto run and make sure your autorun in the program and autorun hotkey in game are the same!

"target": Tab targeting obviously!
